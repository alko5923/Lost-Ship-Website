Hi and welcome to our application!

This is an application for a fictional bar in Uppsala. The bar is called 
The Flying Dutchman and it offers the greatest drinks in the world! 

There are several parts of the application you might be interested to explore:
The Index page is the entry page you first see. Here you can either login in 
with your VIP username and password or with your staff username and password. 
You can also change the language between Enligsh, Swedish and Slovenian. 

If you (dare to) click on the pirate then you get to the Menu page. Here is where
the fun begins. First off, you can browse our amazing selection of drinks. If you
click on the Filter button you get to choose various filtering options which should
make it easier to find just what you are looking for. And once you have found 
what you were looking for, lo and behold! Just grab that thing and drag it to the
left edge of the page where you can drop it! This means you are one step closer 
to drinking your beverage of choice! 

If you are a staff user then please login with your staff username and password. 
This will take you to the staff page where you have loads of functionalities you 
can play around with. Some of them are, unfortunately, now implemented yet, please
see the attached PDF file LOST_SHIP_DEVIATIONS_AND_TIME_REPORT for more on this. 

And finally, if you login in with your owner username and password then you get 
to the owner page where you have some functionalities that are specific to the
owner only. 

We hope you enjoy our application despite its shortcomings! 

Cheers!

Team Lost Ship
